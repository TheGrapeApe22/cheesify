c++ or python??

for generating strings:
    maintain a hash table tokens {token, cheese string}
    getCheese(string token)
        if token isn't in tokens, generate a new string and add it to tokens.
        return tokens[token].

do something special for anything in quotes. backslashes get complicated btw.
skip lines that have "#" or "//" "/*"
