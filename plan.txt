c++ or python??

for generating strings:
    maintain a hash table cheeses {token, cheese string}
    getCheese(string token)
        if token isn't in cheeses, generate a new string and add it to cheeses.
        return cheeses[token].

separate file into tokens
    types of tokens:
        word: string of alphabet, numbers, underscores
        spaces
        newlines
        operators
     
    special:
        quotes
        backslashes
        #
        comments

in new file:
    add the #defines
    write each translated token



GPT PROMPT:
in python i am trying to use re.split() to tokenize.

generate a verbose regex string that separates these in the string:
newlines
strings of spaces
//
/*
*/
"
'
\
#
alphanumeric characters including underscores (use w)
strings of any other symbols, after all others have been separated. do not let this eat other tokens.
