**cheesify** is a python script that rewrites your C and C++ files into an extremely readable format. See `sample_output.c` as an example.

## How to use

Run 
```python3 cheesify.py input_file```, with the path to your C or C++ in place of `input_file`. It will print into standard output, which you can pipe to any file.
