## Welcome to cheesify 🧀
Would you like to make your code unmaintainable forever? Do you hate coding conventions with every cell in your body? Most importantly, do you love cheese? If you answered any of these questions, cheesify is undoubtedly the solution for you.

**cheesify** is a python script that rewrites your C and C++ files into an extremely visually appealing format. See `sample_output.c` as an example.

## How to use

Run cheesify.py:
```shell
python3 cheesify.py input_file
```
with the path to your C or C++ file in place of `input_file`. It will print your cheesified file to stdout, which you can pipe into any output file.

Example usage:
```shell
python3 cheesify.py not_cheesy.c > cheesy.c
```
